I understand you're setting up the project locally and need the commands to get all the necessary dependencies installed. You're right, for a React project, we typically use `npm` (Node Package Manager) or `yarn` for managing packages.

Here are the commands you should follow to set up your project and install all the requirements:

1.  **If you haven't already, create a new React project:**
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-portfolio
    cd my-portfolio
    ```
    (If you already created the `my-portfolio` directory and are inside it, you can skip these two lines.)

2.  **Install the core dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs the default React project dependencies.

3.  **Install Tailwind CSS and Lucide React:**
    ```bash
    npm install tailwindcss lucide-react
    ```

4.  **Initialize Tailwind CSS (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
    This command creates `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files in your project root.

5.  **Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css` files are updated** as described in the `README.md` to include the content paths and Tailwind directives, respectively. This is crucial for Tailwind to work correctly.

6.  **Copy the code into the correct file structure:**
    Make sure you have created the `src/components/` and `src/data/` folders, and then copy the content of the `App.js`, `SectionTitle.js`, `AnimatedCard.js`, `DetailModal.js`, `portfolioData.js`, and `index.css` files into their respective locations as provided in the previous responses.

7.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Following these steps should get your portfolio app running locally! Let me know if you encounter any other issues.
